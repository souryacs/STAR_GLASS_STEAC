Version 1.0
-----------

This version corresponds to the basic release of executing all three methods with single allelle gene trees.
Input gene trees can be in either nexus or newick format.

Version 2.0
------------

Upgraded code to support input multi allele gene trees. Basic dendropy supports single allele gene trees. 
So, we have introduced a parser algorithm which takes care of the alleles and converts input multi 
allele gene trees into a single allele one, suitable for processing in dendropy.

Input gene treelist should be in newick format.
