Version 1.0
-----------

This version corresponds to the basic release of executing all three methods with single allelle gene trees.
Input gene trees can be in either nexus or newick format.

Version 2.0
------------

Improvements in the version:

1) Upgraded code to support input multi allele gene trees. 

Note: Basic dendropy supports single allele gene trees. 
So, we have introduced a parser algorithm which takes care of the alleles and converts input multi 
allele gene trees into a single allele one, suitable for processing in dendropy.

2) Input gene treelist should be in newick format for multi allele gene trees. However, for single allele gene 
trees, nexus formatted input gene trees may  be provided.

3) We have included the method NJ_st (Liu. et. al. 2011) for execution in this new version. The method 
computes the average branch count between individual couplets, with respect to all the gene trees, 
and constructs species tree using Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method.
